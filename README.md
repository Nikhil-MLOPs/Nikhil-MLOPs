## 🧠 About Me: Navigating the Nuances of Data

From an early age, I’ve been driven by curiosity and a desire to challenge myself. This mindset led me to pursue an **M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the prestigious IIT Dhanbad**, where I mastered core technical concepts and honed my problem-solving, analytical, and research skills through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects.  

After completing my M.Tech, I took on one of India’s most competitive challenges: the **UPSC Civil Services Exam**. Although I narrowly missed the prelims by just **0.17 marks**, the experience taught me invaluable lessons in **resilience, discipline, strategic planning, and mental endurance**—qualities that now shape my professional and personal approach.  

Mathematics has always been a central passion of mine, and over time, this evolved into an interest in **Python and programming**, which eventually led me to **Data Science and Machine Learning**. Recognizing the need for practical, real-world experience, I enrolled in a **6-month intensive Data Science & Machine Learning program at Odin School**, where I applied theory to real-world datasets and projects.  

Today, I’m applying my skills as a **Quantitative Analyst at Opendoor (on payroll of Home.LLC)**, working on high-impact projects, collaborating with professionals, and continuously expanding my knowledge.  

Beyond my professional work, I am actively developing **personal projects** to strengthen my expertise and explore cutting-edge applications:  
- **RAG Systems:** Implementing retrieval-augmented systems for intelligent document querying.  
- **GPT-2 LLM from Scratch:** Building language models end-to-end, from tokenization to training pipelines and inference.  
- **MLOps Principles:** Designing production-grade ML workflows, including **CI/CD, Docker/Kubernetes deployments, experiment tracking, and cloud monitoring**.  

Along my journey, I have also:  
- **Built a GPT-2 LLM from scratch**, implementing everything from tokenization to training pipelines and inference mechanisms.  
- **Developed a PDF RAG system** for intelligent document querying, combining embeddings and LLMs to extract insights efficiently.  
- **Designed production-ready ML workflows** with CI/CD, Docker/Kubernetes deployments, and cloud-based monitoring for real-world applications.  

I believe that data is not just numbers—it’s a powerful tool to **solve real-world problems, uncover insights, and drive meaningful change**. My journey may not have been linear, but it has made me a **disciplined, adaptable, and relentlessly curious professional**, eager to contribute to the ever-evolving world of **Data Science & MLOps**.  

I am now **actively seeking opportunities** where I can leverage my technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and hands-on experience to **build scalable ML systems, implement MLOps principles, and drive data-driven impact** in a professional setting.  

I thrive on challenges, enjoy learning continuously, and aim to create **impactful solutions** that blend logic, creativity, and technological excellence.
